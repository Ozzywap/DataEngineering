## Bash Scripting



### Project Description
Bash script to download text files and insert into and read from a SQL database  
<br>

### Table of content
1. Bash Script


I am beginning with a [tutorial](https://bit.ly/3bTmam0) on bash scripting to understand the syntax.

Following this I will go over SQL commands to create and add to tables as well as retrieve information.

Finally I will have to create a script to do this while checking for failure at each stage
