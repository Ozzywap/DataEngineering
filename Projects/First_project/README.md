### Project Description
Bash script to download text files and insert into and read from a SQL database  

### Project outline

---

I am beginning with a [tutorial](https://bit.ly/3bTmam0) on bash scripting to understand the syntax.

Following this I will use SQL to create and add data to tables as well as retrieve said data from the tables and return it to user.

Finally I will create a script to do this while checking for failure at each stage
